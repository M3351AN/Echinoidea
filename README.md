 **Echinoidea A.K.A.雲丹 - is a lightweight opensource CS:GO external cheat, which aviod write memory in order to avoid anti cheat detect**

## About
Echinoidea - is an external hack.\
Since it is a public cheat, I strongly recommend reimplementing the cheat logic to make it as unique as possible, or at least changing the filename (as well as it's hash) of the executable file after compilation to minimise the VAC ban risks.\
Also it might be useful to add some junk code in some cases.\
It's recommended to use [VAC Bypass](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass-Loader) to bypass anti-cheat scan and drastically reduce the likelihood of a VAC ban.\
Use at own risk!\
